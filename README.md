# 🍩 Donut in Python

Welcome to **Donut-in-Python**!  
This is a Python implementation of the legendary ASCII spinning donut, inspired by the classic [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html) — now reimagined for your terminal!

---

## 🎬 Live Demo

```bash
python donut.py
```
> Watch the magic unfold in your terminal!

## 🕹️ Interactive Controls

- **Press `Ctrl+C`** to stop the animation at any time.
- Try modifying the code to change the speed, size, or characters for the donut.
- Challenge: Can you make your donut spin the other way? Or add color?

---

## 🌟 Features

- Pure Python, no dependencies
- Beautiful ASCII donut that animates in your terminal
- Well-commented for learning and tinkering

## 📚 How It Works

The magic behind this spinning donut lies in some clever math and trigonometry, which transforms 3D coordinates into a mesmerizing 2D animation using ASCII characters for shading.
